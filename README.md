💰 Expense Tracker with Budget Management (MERN Stack)

📝 Description:
A full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, Node.js). Users can manage daily expenses, define monthly budgets, categorize spending, and visualize budget performance using interactive charts.

🎯 Key Features:
• ✅ User Sign Up / Login with JWT
• ✅ Add, edit, and delete expenses
• ✅ Set and track monthly budgets
• ✅ Categorize expenses (e.g., Food, Rent, Travel)
• ✅ Chart-based budget vs. expense visualization
• ✅ Responsive design for mobile and desktop
• ✅ REST API integration with secure routes

🧰 Tech Stack:
• Frontend: ReactJS, Axios, Chart.js, HTML, CSS
• Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
• Auth & Security: JWT, bcryptjs
• Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Render or Railway (backend)
• Tools: Postman, GitHub, VS Code

📂 Folder Structure:
• client/ – React frontend
• server/ – Express backend
• models/ – Mongoose schemas
• routes/ – API endpoints
• controllers/ – Business logic
• middleware/ – JWT auth checks

📊 What I Learned:
• Building full-stack apps with MERN
• Creating protected API routes with JWT
• State management with React Hooks
• Frontend/backend data sync via Axios
• Visualizing data using Chart.js
• Deploying apps on Vercel and Render

🚧 Challenges Faced:
• Designing a scalable expense schema
• Handling real-time UI state and validations
• Setting up secure login routes and token storage
• Making responsive layouts for small screens
