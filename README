💰 Expense Tracker with Budget Management (MERN Stack)

📝 Description:
A full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, Node.js). Users can manage daily expenses, define monthly budgets, categorize spending, and visualize budget performance using interactive charts.

🎯 Key Features:
✅ User Sign Up / Login with JWT
✅ Add, edit, and delete expenses
✅ Set and track monthly budgets
✅ Categorize expenses (e.g., Food, Rent, Travel)
✅ Chart-based budget vs. expense visualization
✅ Responsive design for mobile and desktop
✅ REST API integration with secure routes

🧰 Tech Stack:
Frontend: ReactJS, Axios, Chart.js, HTML, CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
Auth & Security: JWT, bcryptjs
Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Render or Railway (backend)
Tools: Postman, GitHub, VS Code

📂 Folder Structure:
client/ – React frontend
server/ – Express backend
models/ – Mongoose schemas
routes/ – API endpoints
controllers/ – Business logic
middleware/ – JWT auth checks

📊 What I Learned:

Building full-stack apps with MERN
Creating protected API routes with JWT
State management with React Hooks
Frontend/backend data sync via Axios
Visualizing data using Chart.js
Deploying apps on Vercel and Render

🚧 Challenges Faced:

Designing a scalable expense schema
Handling real-time UI state and validations
Setting up secure login routes and token storage
Making responsive layouts for small screens
